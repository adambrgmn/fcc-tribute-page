        <p class="lead">Sheriff Woody Pride, or simply Woody, is a fictional character in the Toy Story franchise. He is voiced by Tom Hanks in all of the feature-length and short films and by Jim Hanks in other media. He is a stuffed cowboy character that leads the other toys in adventures in the movies. His facial features are based on Tone Thyne, an animator for Disney at the time.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p class="m-b-0">Woody is a passionate guy who throws himself into every action. As soon as he has an instinctive thought like "I have to help them," or "I have to run away," he does it with 100-percent commitment. You gotta love that about anybody. What's great is that I get credit for the way the character and the humor come off. I have kids that are now in college come up to me and say, "when you told that neighbor kid to play nice, that really meant a lot to me".</p>
          <footer class="blockquote-footer">Tom Hanks from <cite title="Wikipedia - Woody">Wikipedia</cite></footer>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Woody is an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll. The voice-box that is activated by the pull-string says many simple phrases such as "Reach for the sky!", "You're my favorite deputy!", "There's a snake in my boots!", and "Somebody's poisoned the waterhole!".</p>
        <p>As mentioned in Toy Story 2, his construction includes an "original hand-painted face, natural dyed-blanket stitched vest, and hand-stitched poly-vinyl hat." Woody wears an empty gun holster at his belt. He is Andy's favorite toy since kindergarten, with a special spot on the bed, and is the leader of the toys in Andy's room.</p>
        <p>In Toy Story 2, it is revealed that he is based on the main character from a popular 1950s TV show, Woody's Roundup. When Al is bargaining with Andy's mom in an attempt to take Woody, Andy's mom declines Al's bargain, stating that Woody is "an old family toy."</p>
        <p>Stinky Pete also directly refers to him as a hand-me-down toy later in the movie, and when Woody finds a record player in Al's apartment room, he states "I haven't seen one of these in ages!", again supporting that he has been around longer than Andy. (In fact, when introducing the 2009 set of Toy Story collectibles, John Lasseter said "We always imagined he was a hand-me-down to Andy from his father.")</p>
        <p>He is voiced by Tom Hanks in the films and by his brother Jim Hanks on other occasions.</p>
